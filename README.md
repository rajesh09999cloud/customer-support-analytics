"ML-powered customer support ticket classification system with Streamlit dashboard"

  Live Dashboard Access:
  
The interactive dashboard is deployed and accessible at:
http://localhost:8502/

  Project Overview:

A comprehensive end-to-end machine learning solution for analyzing and automatically classifying customer support tickets. This system helps businesses streamline their support operations by categorizing incoming tickets, predicting priorities, and providing actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

   Key Features:
   
Automated Ticket Categorization: Machine learning models to automatically classify tickets into categories (Billing, Technical, Account, General)

Priority Prediction: Predict ticket urgency based on content and metadata

Interactive Dashboard: Real-time visualization of support metrics and trends

Performance Analytics: Resolution time analysis and agent performance tracking

Text Analysis: NLP-powered insights from ticket content

   Technical Stack:
   
Programming: Python 3.8+

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, NLTK

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Dashboard: Streamlit

Data: Synthetic customer support dataset
